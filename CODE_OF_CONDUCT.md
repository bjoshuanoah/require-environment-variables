# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This is a welcoming place, and we'll make sure it stays that way.

## Our Standards

Don't virtue signal.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't have thin skin.
Check your ego at the door.

## Our Responsibilities

We will tell if you're being an asshole. We will tell you if you have thin skin.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at brianjoshuanoah@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
